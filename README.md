# NHANES Sleep, Health, and Depression Analysis (2021–2023)

This repository contains cleaned and merged data from the **National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2021–2023** public-use files. The project explores relationships between sleep, physical health behaviors, biomarkers, socioeconomic factors, and depression outcomes in U.S. adults.

All data are publicly available and provided by the **U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)**.

## Project Focus

This project investigates how sleep, physical activity, BMI, inflammation, smoking, work status, and socioeconomic status relate to **depression severity (PHQ-9)** using statistical and machine learning methods.

---

## Notes

- Only **public-use NHANES data** were used.
- Invalid PHQ-9 responses (7 = refused, 9 = don’t know) were treated as missing.
- Special missing value codes (e.g., 7777, 9999) were cleaned to `NA` in activity and smoking variables.
- All datasets were merged using `SEQN`.
- This repository is intended for educational and research purposes.

## PHQ-9 Depression Scoring

Depression symptoms were assessed using the **Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)** from the NHANES Mental Health – Depression Screener component (`DPQ_L`). The PHQ-9 is a validated nine-item screening instrument that measures the frequency of depressive symptoms over the past two weeks and is based on DSM-IV diagnostic criteria (Kroenke & Spitzer, 2002).

Each of the nine symptom items (`DPQ010`–`DPQ090`) is scored on a 4-point scale:
- 0 = Not at all  
- 1 = Several days  
- 2 = More than half the days  
- 3 = Nearly every day  

Responses coded as **7 (Refused)** or **9 (Don’t know)** were treated as missing and excluded from scoring.

PHQ‑9 total scores were calculated only for participants with complete responses to all nine symptom items, following NHANES analytic guidelines.

### Total PHQ-9 Score
A total PHQ-9 score was calculated by summing the nine symptom items, yielding a possible range from **0 to 27**. Scores were only computed for participants with complete responses to all nine items.

### Depression Classification
In addition to the continuous total score, a binary depression indicator was created using a standard clinical cutoff:
- **PHQ-9 ≥ 10** indicates moderate to severe depressive symptoms.

| Severity Level        | Score Range |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| None / Minimal        | 0–4         |
| Mild                  | 5–9         |
| Moderate              | 10–14       |
| Moderately Severe     | 15–19       |
| Severe                | 20–27       |

Only data from participants **aged 18 years and older** were included, as adult PHQ-9 data are publicly available for NHANES 2021–2023. Youth depression data (ages 12–17) are available only through the NCHS Research Data Center and were not used in this project.

- `phq9_severity`: Categorical label (None, Mild, Moderate, etc.)
- `is_depressed`: Binary indicator (1 = PHQ-9 ≥ 10)
- `sleep_avg`: Weighted weekly average based on weekday and weekend sleep
- `bmi`, `crp`, `age`: Cleaned/renamed raw variables
- `cigarettes_per_day`: Cleaned version of SMD641 (99 coded as NA)

- `vigorous_activity_category`: Categorized (None, Low, Moderate, High)
- `moderate_activity_frequency`: Frequency of moderate activity (PAD810Q)
- `moderate_activity_units`: Units (per day/week/month/year)
- `moderate_activity_minutes`: Duration of moderate sessions (PAD820)
- `employment_status`: Recoded from OCD150 into “Working” vs “Not working”

---

## Missing Data Handling

- PHQ-9 and other fields with invalid codes were filtered or recoded as NA.
- Non-numeric codes like `7777`, `9999`, and `99` were removed before analysis.
- Only complete cases for core variables were included in analysis-ready CSV.
